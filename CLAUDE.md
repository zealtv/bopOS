# Working notes for agents

bopOS is a Raspberry Pi + Pure Data framework for networked multi-device sound
installations. This file is the orientation for any agent working here.

## Start here

1. `README.md` — system overview, OSC port map, patch system.
2. `docs/OSC-CONTRACT.md` — the **ratified** OSC contract (v1.0, 2026-07-07): grammar,
   planes, identity/persistence, ports, constraints. Don't re-litigate it; the
   reasoning lives in lore item `2026-07-07-osc-schema-council`.
3. `.notes/architecture-review-2026-07-05.md` — the current architectural review and
   forward plan; the shared context every loom thread points back to.
4. `./.loom/loom status` — live task state. The loom (`.loom/`) is the task tracker;
   read `.loom/README.md` for the protocol (claim → work → tie; split when too big).
5. `.notes/dashboard-development-context.md` — full dashboard design (stack, protocol,
   UI) if working on dashboard threads.

## House rules

- **NEVER edit Pure Data patches (`.pd` files).** PD programming is Bob's domain.
  Agents work on Python, Bash, JS/HTML, architecture, and docs.
- **PD float precision:** PD's OSC floats are 32-bit. Never send a value needing >6
  significant figures (epoch timestamps, fine clocks) through PD as a float — encode
  64-bit values as strings or int pairs, and keep absolute time out of PD entirely.
- **Decision gates:** some choices are Bob's to ratify — the OSC port/namespace
  redesign, scene-language syntax, engine strategy calls, anything user-facing in the
  facilitator view. Produce a written proposal (see Lore below), mark the stitch
  `.waiting`, and surface it to Bob. Don't implement past an unratified design.
- Commit style: plain prose subject line (match `git log`), body explaining why.

## Thread ordering (critical path)

The OSC contract is **ratified** (design draft tied 2026-07-07). Execution order is in
`.loom/threads/osc-schema-contract/HANDOFF.md` — in short: `dashboard-0-sim-fleet`
→ `osc-schema-contract` children (`node-contract-fixes`, `hb-identity`,
`assign-persistence`, `patch-manifest`, `fetch-landing`)
→ `dashboard` phases 1–4 → `clock-sync` → `spatial-audio` / `scene-sequencing`.

Free-floating, any time: `sample-distribution`, `audio-input`, `pi-zero-performance`
(measurement half), `patch-workflow-friction` (mostly falls out of dashboard-4),
`audition-rig` (spike its port-sharing child first; Stage A wants the dashboard
spatial map).
Gated by instruction: `video-mask`, the SC proof-of-concept, spatial-audio Stage B.
Cross-repo: spool-scoped siblings live in `kite-choir-brains/.loom` (`bopos-uptodate`) —
coordinate, don't duplicate.

## Testing without hardware

- **Simulated fleet:** `dashboard-0-sim-fleet` builds `tools/simfleet.py` — N fake Pis
  speaking the real OSC protocol (heartbeats on 5550, commands on 6660). Once it
  exists, use it for all dashboard/clock-sync/scene development; treat it as part of
  the deliverable (new protocol features land in the simulator in the same stitch).
- **Laptop rig:** `bash/start-laptop.sh` runs PD + the io bridge on a laptop
  (MCP2221A USB-I2C adapter) for peripheral work.
- **Audible fleet:** `audition-rig` builds the composition monitor — N real engine
  instances on the laptop, spatially mixed. Protocol-only (`simfleet`) and audible
  instances should stay config-compatible so they can mix in one session.
- **Real Pi loop:** the edit→push→pull-on-Pi dance and the stop-stack/restart test
  sequence are documented in `kite-choir-brains/.claude/skills/bopos-dev/SKILL.md`.
  Hardware verification ultimately needs Bob or a live rig — say so in the stitch
  rather than claiming it verified.

## Records

- `.lore/` holds complete dated artifacts — design proposals, decision records,
  session transcripts. `./lore.sh keep <prepared-dir> <slug>`; read `.lore/INDEX.md`
  deliberately, don't auto-load it. Design drafts awaiting ratification live here.
- `.notes/` holds current working reference (revisable); `docs/` (once created) holds
  durable specs like `OSC-CONTRACT.md`.
- Put working artifacts (measurements, logs, decision notes) inside the stitch
  directory — they travel with it into `tied/`.
