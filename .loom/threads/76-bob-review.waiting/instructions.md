# 76-bob-review

**Status:** waiting on Bob · collected 2026-10-04 while working the projects queue
**Goal:** one place for everything from that session that needs Bob's review,
ruling or hands on hardware. Agents: don't work this stitch; it's Bob's.

Bob, 2026-10-04: *"anything i need to review put it in a single stitch so i can
look at it all at once after this session"*. Each item points at where the
evidence lives; the stitches named stay where they are. When an item is ruled,
record the ruling in the stitch it points at (resume it if it's waiting), then
move it to Ruled here. Tie this when Open and Hardware checks are empty.

## Open

3. **OSC contract editorial**: `docs/OSC-CONTRACT.md` (~line 859) still says
   the facilitator allowlist lives in `installation.json`. Since 66/3 it's
   `project.json`. Change the filename only? → `33b/2` notes.

## Hardware checks (Bob's hands; software halves are done)

1. **Wi-Fi slice 0**: with a Pi up, choose the network manager. The helper
   backend is a marked seam that reports `unavailable` until then. →
   `33b/2-network-config-implementation.waiting`.
2. **Wi-Fi switchover rehearsal**: both APs up, push the list, disable
   *testing*, devices reappear on the hidden show network; disable show 1, and
   the fallback takes over. → same stitch.

## Ruled

1. Passphrase warning wording — **yes**, as it reads in the app (Bob, 2026-10-04,
   via Tengu) → recorded in `33b/2`.
2. Migrate `dashboard/shows/test.json` into the project's `show.json` and delete
   `dashboard/shows/` — **yes** (Bob, 2026-10-04) → recorded in `66-projects/5-one-show`.
